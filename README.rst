Burst Search
============

Perform real-time and off-line searches for fast radio bursts.

This package was developed to search for fast radio bursts in GUPPI data from
the Green Bank Telescope.  It was used to discover FRB110523, and has been
further deployed at the Algonquin Radio Observatory and by the CHIME FRB
experiment.
